# Click Collector

A simple React project for week 1 of Lighthall's Software Engineering Super League. See who else clicked the button and where they're from!

Note: Location tracking must be enable for the geolocation feature to work properly.

The assets for this project come from the default assets generated by create-react-app, and are not my own
